# Python Fundamentals — Structured Learning Repository

## Overview

This repository documents my structured transition into software development.

Focus areas:

- Functions (`def`, parameters, return values)
- Conditional logic (`if / elif / else`)
- Boolean expressions
- Comparison operators
- Loops (`while`)
- Debugging and execution flow understanding

The objective is not volume, but structural clarity and logical consistency.

## Learning Philosophy

- No copy/paste solutions
- Error-driven correction
- Repetition for structural fixation
- Gradual increase of abstraction
- Focus on reasoning before speed

---

## Current Stage

Fundamentals consolidation:
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Boolean logic
- Loop introduction

Mini-projects will be added after structural stability.

---

## Repository Structure

Each exercise will be added as an individual `.py` file, clearly named by topic and progression order.

Example:

- `01_basics/`
- `02_condicionals/`
- `03_loops/`
- `04_functions/`
- `05_practice/`

## Goal

Build a solid foundation to progress toward junior-level problem solving with:

- Clean logic
- Predictable structure
- Independent debugging capability
